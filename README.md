# LemASM
LemASM is an Assembly-like language that revolves around a stack, this is the bundled LemASM interpreter.

## Getting Started
To get started either compile the repository using make or the bundled LemASM.exe file.<br>
Then create a ".lemasm" or ".lasm file".<br>
Lastly, compile your LemASM code with ./LemASM <file_name>.lemasm or ./LemASM <file_name>.lasm.<br>
For further documentation please refer to "documentation/LemASMDocumentation.html".<br>
If you wish to contribute to this repository you are more than welcome to.

You can use -h to get directed directly to the embedded help HTML and documentaion file. Example: ./LemASM <file_name>.lemasm -h<br>

You can use -o <output_file_name> to get an output_file. Example: ./LemASM <file_name>.lemasm -o <output_file_name>
